## Sound layer Colour Conversion 
Converts an audio signal into colours based on frequency and harmonics and displays them as particles.

## Background

Visual aids have been useful within music production , although arguably it takes away from focusing on what our ears can hear, they have changed the way in which many users perceive the behaviour of a sound. The spectrum analyser as an example allows listeners to easily identify fundamental frequencies and resonances or balance a mix. Another use of the spectrum analyser is measuring the frequency response of a room with the utilisation of white/pink noise and a microphone. While this use of display works for providing information for technical processes, the same informance could be displayed providing more creative information. 

Synesthesia, taken from the Greek words syn meaning ‘together’, and aesthesis meaning ‘perception’, is "sensation in one part of the body produced by stimulus in another," (online etymology dictionary 2018). In this case, Seeing Sounds as shapes and colors (Chromesthesia) As Goldsmith points out “no common set of color and sound associations exist between individual synesthetes. Synesthesia is a personal experience and the details of the perceptions are completely subjective” and so there is no overall way to represent this for all synesthetes to see as accurate. What can be taken from this is that, like synesthetes, we can use technology to be given a new sensation when hearing sounds, through the use of shapes and colours.

## MIDI vs OSC 

"Application areas for MIDI include music, lighting control, show control (and themed events), machine control (audio and video), robotics, and more" (TMA)
While it would enable us a reasonable set of control and information to take from sound MIDI is primarily a language of predefined messages meaning that it might not be adaptable to the range of existing instruments and how they are played while OSC is completely customisable. TMA (The Midi Association) argues "any software or hardware manufacture may obtain a unique ID that enables them to create System Exclusive messages which can have any structure and use any data format" however this still applies to a language while this project aims to work with audio. The signal would have to be converted into MIDI before being able to utilise it taking away the option of microtuning etc. To keep up with the different behaviours of sound it may be more suitable to use OSC and customise it to process multiple variations of information.
